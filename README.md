# SwooperGui.py

## This is a IOT Recon tool I made in my late Junior year of highschool is further investigate my school's network

  It uses:

- Python's Asyncio Module & Threading
- Textual (CLI -> GUI) and Rich (for debugging)
- CSV Parsing, to dump Results into a compatible format
- BeautifulSoup4, fast a reliable HTML Parsing for title grabbing (This is a IOT scanner remember?)
- Other misc. helper modules for IP conversion (Str->Int and back again) and others

This code was made when I was a beginner...
so a decent bit of the code is utterly unreadable,
but for the most part it does work ~~(assuming you pray and plead to the Python gods for it to do so)~~

The goal of uploading this to github is to:

1. Rework the Backend
   - upgrade the Requester system
   - upgrade the File/Storage system

2. Clean up the frontend code
   - make it readable and annotating the heck out of it.
  
3. Prevent random crashes from occuring
   - Add logging maybe?
